# About Me
![screenshot](/Prinssss.jfif)

Hello, my name is Prince Christian C. Divina, and I'm currently taking my first year of BS Information Systems at City College of Angeles. I enjoy playing games in my free time, Iâ€™m a chill guy stress and I have an unspoken agreement to avoid each other as much as possible. Also, I have a passion for technology, mostly because I rely on it to procrastinate efficiently.
